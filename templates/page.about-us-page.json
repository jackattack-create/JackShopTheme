When reflecting on strengths that drive everyday life, Madhu and his wife knew their strength stemmed from kindness. Let Kimbala inspire you to consider your own strengths and let them guide you through life’s journey.   Kimbala’s logo is a semicolon (“;”), an intention to pause and remind yourself of the strength you own and how you will use it. When you pause, you reflect and enjoy what\/who surrounds you. The elephant portion of our semicolon represents a strong but kind member of the animal kingdom, reminding once more of Kimbala’s “strength in kindness”.",
